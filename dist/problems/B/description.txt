Problem B: Linear Search

Given an array of N integers and a target value X, find the first occurrence of X in the array.
Print the 0-based index of X. If X is not found, print -1.

Input:
The first line contains two integers N and X (1 <= N <= 1000, -10^9 <= X <= 10^9).
The second line contains N space-separated integers representing the array elements.

Output:
Print a single integer: the index of X or -1.

Example:
Input:
5 10
2 5 8 10 15
Output:
3
